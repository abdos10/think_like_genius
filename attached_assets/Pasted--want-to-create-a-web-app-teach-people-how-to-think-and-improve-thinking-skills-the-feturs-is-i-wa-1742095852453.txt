 want to create a web app teach people how to think and improve thinking skills the feturs is : i wanna add is that the user can interace with ai and train or practice deferent type of thinking like (criticle , creative, stratigic , ....) and see his level in each one with some graphics and ,the user can enter type of problem(realLife, coding, math, bussiness...) then add the context or description of it and he get the thinking process or steps to solve this problem or he can add a spacifice result or solution that he need to learn how to think in it, also he can add a problem and the thinking process and the ai will give him feedback and teach him how to improve the thinking process, also a varify thinking so the user enter the thinking process and the result and ai tell him if this process leads to this result, another things. i need to describe the ui ux part
